## Project Title
Nasa Turbo engine dataset using Classification

## Turbo Engine data description
CMAPSS stands for Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation. It is a system developed by NASA to study engine degradation. It is coded in MATLAB and Simulink (A toolbox of MATLAB).

The engine under study is a turbofan engine (a jet engine). A turbofan engine has many components. A few important components are: Fan, Low Pressure Compressor (LPC), High Pressure Compressor (HPC), Low Pressure Turbine (LPT), High Pressure Turbine (HPT).

During operation, degradation occurs in each of the components. If degradation level in any component exceeds a threshold, the engine is said to have failed. We don't want jet engines to fail mid-air. Therefore, jet engines are inspected before every take off. This is a form of periodic maintenance that is not cost effective.

But given the critical nature of operation (considering human lives involved), this form of maintenance strategy is justified. Even then, we need a system that can given us early warning if something is going to fail.

An early warning, in many cases, may help us prepare for the problem, if not prevent it altogether. A sufficiently early warning will enable us to prevent the disaster. But if an early warning is too conservative, it will lead to unnecessary waste of money. So, aim of a predictive maintenance system is to predict the RUL as accurately as possible such that it is neither too early nor too late.

## Classification Problem Formulation
The challange of this competetion was to predict the Remaining Useful Life of the engine by using the given sensor's data and operational conditions.

But in this project, we ll try to simplify that by converting it to a Classification Problem. Where, the classes/labels will of 3 types, i.e. Good Condition, Moderate Condition and Warning Condition.

## Experimental Scenario
Data sets consists of multiple multivariate time series. Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine â€“ i.e., the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise.

The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective of the competition is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data.

The data are provided as a zip-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers, separated by spaces. Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle, each column is a different variable. The columns correspond to:
1)	unit number
2)	time, in cycles
3)	operational setting 1
4)	operational setting 2
5)	operational setting 3

## Defining the labels
Here we will define the engine's condition with Life Ratio (LR), which is the ratio between Current Cycle and the End cycle/ End of Life(EOL). If LR=0, that means the component has just started its degradation and LR=1 means, it is completely degraded.

if LR <= 0.6 - Good Condition
if 0.6 < LR <= 0.8 - Moderate Condition
if 0.8 < LR - Warning Condition
